# Pretty hyply

> TL;DR Pretty hyply is basically the hyperpolyglot binary but with colored output.

Pretty hyply is a by product from my other project `Catalyst` that uses this functionality as a component. i basically refactored it into a binary.

For now when the directory uses a language that doesn't have a color, it displays it in white as a fallback. But that might change in the future using environment variables or a configuration file.
